## Overview

Venomous Snake Detection is a computer vision project aimed at automatically detecting venomous snakes in images or video footage. The project utilizes deep learning techniques to identify and classify venomous snake species, providing a valuable tool for snakebite prevention and wildlife conservation efforts.

## Features

- Automatic detection of venomous snakes in images or video streams.
- Classification of snake species based on visual features.
- Real-time detection capabilities for use in field applications.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction and visualization of results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/venomous-snake-detection.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download pre-trained models (if applicable) from [link to model repository or source].

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd venomous-snake-detection
   ```

2. Run the snake detection script:
   ```
   python detect_snakes.py --image <path_to_image>
   ```

   Replace `<path_to_image>` with the path to the image file you want to analyze.

3. View the results:
   - Detected snakes will be outlined with bounding boxes on the image.
   - Classification labels will be displayed for each detected snake.
